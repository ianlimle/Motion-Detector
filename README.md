# Motion-Detector
OpenCV is used to calculate frame deltas against the most recent saved frame and the current frame. The frame deltas are then passed through a threshold filter, and bounding boxes are drawn around contours of the thresholded frame. A sufficiently large bounding box derived from the contours of a thresholded frame delta image is considered movement.

# Final Prototype for Live Fish Count 
#a motion detector to test proof the concept of video analytics in optimizing situational awareness of key water installations
#The aim is to contribute to a Smart Water Security Management ecosystem with artificial intelligence and automation 
#It detects transient motion in a location and if said movement is large enough, and recent enough, reports that there is motion
#This video analytics module can be interfaced to other devices or systems (ie drones, UAV or autonomous vehicles) where operational #requirements demand
